# Virtual Piano
One of the many things that a front-end developer has to take care of is binding the functionality of a web application to the keys on the keyboard. In order to develop and strengthen the important skills of working with keyboard keys, we will make a virtual piano in this project.

You will learn how to write HTML documents and work with the most popular CSS properties. You will also learn how to use JavaScript to make event handlers for browser events and create and insert new elements into documents.

## Stages
**Stage 1/5: Add markup**\
First, you need to add some elements to the body of the HTML document and learn to work with tags responsible for user input from the keyboard.

**Stage 2/5: Page styling**\
This stage is an opportunity to improve the appearance of your piano and make your application not only interesting but unique.

**Stage 3/5: Application functionality**\
Learn how to create events that occur when a key is pressed on the keyboard.

**Stage 4/5: Let there be music**\
Now, let's teach our musical instrument how to actually produce sound.

**Stage 5/5: Adding and styling new keys**\
Finally, add the black keys to your piano and customize them. We're done!
